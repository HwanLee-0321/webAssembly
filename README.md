# WebAssembly C to JavaScript Example

This project is a simple demonstration of how to compile a C function into WebAssembly (Wasm) and use it within a web page using JavaScript.

[About Post](https://velog.io/@hwan_lee/%EC%96%B4%EC%85%88%EB%B8%94%EB%A6%AC%EB%A1%9C-%EC%9B%B9-%EB%A7%8C%EB%93%A4%EA%B8%B0)

## üìÇ File Descriptions

-   `index.html`: The main HTML file that loads and displays the result from the WebAssembly module.
-   `add.c`: The source C code containing a simple `add` function that adds two integers.
-   `add.wasm`: The compiled WebAssembly binary generated from `add.c`.
-   `add.js`: The JavaScript "glue" code generated by Emscripten, which makes it easy to load and interact with the `add.wasm` module.

## üöÄ How to Run

To run this example, you need to serve the files using a local web server due to browser security policies (CORS) for fetching the `.wasm` file.

1.  **Start a local server:**
    If you have Python installed, you can easily start a server in the project's root directory.

    ```bash
    # For Python 3
    python -m http.server

    # For Python 2
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer
    ```

2.  **Open in browser:**
    Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

You should see the result of `40 + 2 = 42` calculated by the C function via WebAssembly.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Build

The `add.wasm` and `add.js` files were generated from `add.c` using the [Emscripten SDK](https://emscripten.org/).

If you have Emscripten installed and configured, you can rebuild the files with the following command:

```bash
emcc add.c -o add.js
```

This command compiles the C code, generates the WebAssembly binary (`.wasm`), and creates the necessary JavaScript glue code (`.js`) to run it in the browser.
